This is a software implementation of the Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) Calculator.

The RBS Calculator can predict the translation initiation rate of a protein coding sequence in bacteria. It can also design synthetic ribosome binding site sequences to rationally control the protein expression level. It combines a thermodynamic model of ribosome and mRNA interactions with a sequence optimization algorithm. The RBS Calculator was developed by Howard Salis and Chris Voigt at UC San Francisco.

Please read H.M. Salis, E.A. Mirsky, C.A. Voigt, Nature Biotechnology, 2009 for technical details.

**  A New and Improved Version of the RBS Calculator Has Been Developed with Greater Predictive Accuracy and a User-Friendly Web Interface  **
The first round of improvements have been described in:  HM Salis, "The Ribosome Binding Site Calculator", Synthetic Biology: Methods for Building and Programming Life, 19
